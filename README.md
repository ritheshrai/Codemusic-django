# CodeMusic:heavy_heart_exclamation:



***CodeMusic*** is project came into existance because of large amount of coders or devlopers keep their mind from becoming a hell-hole in the means of music. Songs keep our sane in check so i wanted To create an custom music streaming service for the personal use.



This Website is written in **Django** framework and this website is in its early days of Alpha testing so this site is pretty buggy and featurless
please Try my website and give any new ideas to improve this to make it an open-source coders community music website with comunity vibes

> :dash: This project is hosted on heroku as [Codemusic-django](https://github.com/ritheshrai/Codemusic-django)


>Issues are most welcomed :relaxed:
